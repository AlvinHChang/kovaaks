# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Additional Steps for installation

To get memoryjs to run, we need to run additional installation steps if you have not run them yet.

Run `npm install -g node-gyp`.

Then run `npm install -g windows-build-tools@4.0.0` (The latest seems to be bugged as of 12/28/2020)
